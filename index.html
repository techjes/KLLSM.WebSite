                    <p class="lead">Traverse City has always been a desirable place to work and live. Today’s Traverse City is growing and its local population is working to adjust to many changes, one of which is the availability of affordable housing that doesn’t break the bank and put an undue burden on residents.</p>

                        <p>Housing prices have continued to rise since the economic recovery following the 2008 recession. As home costs rise, they begin to require a larger percentage of the yearly salary of residents looking to purchase homes, putting those currently buying homes and even looking for rentals closer to being considered “overburdened” by their housing costs.</p>
                        <p>Residents are “overburdened” if housing costs account for greater than 30% of their household’s total income. In Grand Traverse County, the average annual income before taxes is $27,000 per capita and $50,000 for households. With houses averaging over $200,000 and rents upwards of $800 per month, the cost of living can be closer to 50% of household income after taxes and other expenses.</p>
                        <p>With costs going up for everyone and incomes remaining fairly level, it is clear that the Traverse City area is in need of more affordable housing options. Fewer “overburdened” residents would result in increased activity in other sectors of the local economy.</p>

                        <h3>Availability in Michigan</h3>
                        <p>To better understand the housing situation in the Traverse City area, it can be useful to compare it with other cities in Michigan. For example, if you are currently searching for a home in the Traverse City area, there are 14 listings in good condition that can be considered “affordable,” ranging from $150,000 to $200,000.</p>
                        <p>In nearby Cadillac, you can currently find 50 listings in good condition that are in the more affordable $50,000 to $140,000 range. If you look toward a larger city in Michigan, Detroit offers a large mix of housing choices, but affordable options that are in good condition are still abundant with 410 listings between $50,000 and $180,000. For something in between, Jackson Michigan offers 241 listing between $60,000 and $180,000. Even comparable tourist towns in the area offer more options with typically lower prices. Petoskey currently has 26 listings that range between $80,000 and $180,000. In this larger context, it becomes clear that Traverse City currently lacks affordable housing both in terms of price and availability, and the areas that have more affordable housing options lack the necessary income levels.</p>
